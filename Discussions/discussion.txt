If gene has max Radius of 7, we take all genes in this radius, we check the decay, 

Module/Isolated/Linker ??
Classify -> Decayed Gene 

Decayed: This gene is only selected because its in the radius of a DE gene which would be normally labeled as module.

600 genes were found to be significant ==> Decayed. 

New genes can be: Decayed 


For each gene, get the neighbours within the radius (in both cases before and after)
check if any of the neighbours are selected in the new one but not in the old one

But what if these genes are picked up by a different center?
If they are picked by different center 

When we run mND we pick a center, and then we pick the neighbors ==> Mark the center and the neighbours picked
Gc1 ==> [G1,g2,g3]
Gc2 ==> [G1,g2,g3]
Gc3 ==> [G1,g2,g3]

When we run new mND we will have the same thing.


Then, from 
For each gene, get the neighbours within the radius (in both cases before and after)
check if any of the neighbours are selected in the new one but not in the old one
